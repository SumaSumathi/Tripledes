# Tripledes
Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a type of computerized cryptography where block cipher algorithms are applied three times to each data block. The key size is increased in Triple DES to ensure additional security through encryption capabilities. Each block contains 64 bits of data. Three keys are referred to as bundle keys with 56 bits per key. There are three keying options in data encryption standards:

All keys being independent
Key 1 and key 2 being independent keys
All three keys being identical
Key option #3 is known as triple DES. The triple DES key length contains 168 bits but the key security falls to 112 bits.
